RedSea
======
Easy to use music downloader and tagger for Tidal. For educational use only, and may break in the future. You still need a Tidal account, but you can just use the free trial month.  

Introduction
------------
RedSea is a music downloader and tagger for the Tidal music streaming service. It is designed partially as a Tidal API example. This repository also hosts a wildly incomplete Python Tidal
API implementation - it is contained in `config/tidal_api.py` and only requires `requests` to be
installed.

Requirements
------------
* Python 3.6
* requests
* mutagen
* pycrypto
* opencv

Setting up (with pip)
------------------------
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
2. Run `python redsea.py -h` to view the help file
3. Run `python redsea.py urls` to download lossless files from urls

Setting up (with Pipenv)
------------------------
1. Run `pipenv install --three` to install dependencies in a virtual env using Pipenv
2. Run `pipenv run python redsea.py -h` to view the help file
3. Run `pipenv run python redsea.py urls` to download lossless files from urls

How to use
----------
    usage: redsea.py [-h] [-id IDENTIFIANT -pwd PASSWORD] [-p PRESET] [-o DIR] [-a ACCOUNT] [-s] urls [urls ...]

    A music downloader for Tidal.

    positional arguments:
    urls                    The URLs to download. You may need to wrap the URLs in
                            double quotes if you have issues downloading.

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help              show this help message and exit
    -p PRESET, --preset PRESET
                            Select a download preset. Defaults to Lossless only.
                            See /config/settings.py for presets
                            
    -id IDENTIFIANT, --identifiant IDENTIFIANT
                            Pass the Tidal identifiant of your account. Must be use with -pwd.
    
    -pwd PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                            Pass the Tidal password of your account. Must be use with -id.
    
    -s, --skip              Pass this flag to skip track and continue when a track
                            does not meet the requested quality                          
    -o DIR, --outidr DIR 
                            Set DIR as the outupt directory. By default it's the
                            same as redsea.py

Issues
------------
* Sometimes, tracks will be tagged with a useless version (for instance, "(album version)"), or have the same version twice "(album version)(album version)". This is because tracks in
    Tidal are not consistent in terms of metadata - sometimes a version may be included in the track title, included in the version field, or both.
    
* Tracks may be tagged with an inaccurate release year; this may be because of Tidal only having the "rerelease" or "remastered" version but showing it as the original.

* Downloading an artist URL actually downloads the content of "best tracks".
